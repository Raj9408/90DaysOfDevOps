What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies that aim to bridge the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its goal is to enhance collaboration, automate processes, and accelerate the delivery of high-quality software.

What is Automation, Scaling, Infrastructure?

1. Automation
    Automation means to do automating for the repetitive tasks in which it include Code building and testing, Infrastructure provisioning, Deployment processes.

2. Scaling
    Scaling means the software which is developed by the development team should be work perfectyly when the more user start using the software, means if more user came then the resousce or the server should autmaicaly be increase and if the load is less then automaticaly remove the extra resosuce of the server.
    

3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
    Managing infrastructure using code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) instead of manual setups ensures consistency and scalability.

Why DevOps is Important:
 DevOps is important because it improves collaboration, automates processes, and speeds up software delivery, enabling faster time-to-market, higher-quality releases, and better customer satisfaction. It also enhances scalability, reduces costs, and integrates security into the development workflow.
