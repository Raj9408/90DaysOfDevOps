Some Basic Command of linux

Today, I spent time learning some basic Linux commands, which are crucial for navigating and managing the file system. Below are some keywords I explored.

Listing Commands

ls -l: This command lists all the files in the directory in a long format, displaying detailed information about each file or directory.

ls -a: This command lists all the hidden files in the directory.

ls -*.sh: This command lists all the files that end with .sh (here * means all files).

ls -i: This command lists all the files in the directory with their index number.

ls -d*/: This command lists only the directories present in the current directory, displaying only the directory names, not their contents.

Commands for Directory

mkdir dir1: This command creates a directory named “dir1”.

mkdir .Folder: This command creates a hidden directory named “Folder”.

mkdir Dev1 Dev2 Dev3: This command creates multiple directories at the same time with the names Dev1, Dev2, and Dev3.

mkdir /home/usr/dir1: This command creates a directory at a specified path.

mkdir -p /a/b/c/d: This command creates nested directories, meaning it will create a directory named “a”, inside that directory “b”, inside that directory “c”, and inside that directory “d”.

pwd: This command shows the current working directory.

cd /a/b/c/d: This command changes the current directory to a specific path.

cd ~: This command changes the current directory to the home directory.

cd -: This command moves to the last working directory.

cd ..: This command moves one step back to the parent directory.

cd ../..: This command moves two steps back to the parent directory.
